<p><em>Fall 2020 will be a strange semester. My operating principle is that we
are all trying our best. I will work to accommodate personal
emergencies, unpredictable schedules, general chaos as best I can.</em></p>
<div id="course-description" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>Course description</h1>
<p><strong>Credits: 3</strong></p>
<p>Thiscourse will provide a theoretical and practical background in basic
econometric techniques. We will review probability and statistics before
covering classical linear regression with two or more variables,
estimation and hypothesis testing, and violations of classical
assumptions. EC200 is a challenging course. If you are not interested in
taking a challenging course, you should take a different course. The
prerequisites are EC170, EC171, and EC172.</p>
<p>The course will combine lectures, discussion, and lots of practice.
Learning econometrics requires a healthy blend of theory and practice,
so you will complete problem sets throughout the semester, and you will
design and and write a short research paper that applies some of the
techniques we’ve learned about to real-world data. We won’t have enough
course time to cover all the Stata preparation you’ll need, but I’ll
cover the basics and you’ll have to rely on other resources to figure
out the rest.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>Learning objectives:</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>To understand and apply foundational tools in econometric theory</p></li>
<li><p>To use econometric tools and statistical packages (Stata) to analyze
real-world data and interpret findings</p></li>
<li><p>To formulate, assess, and answer economic questions by selecting and
applying appropriate econometric techniques</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="required-materials" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>Required materials</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Textbook:</strong> Stock, James H. and Mark W. Watson. <em>Introduction to
Econometrics</em>, 3rd edition (updated), Pearson. ISBN-13:
978-0-13-348687-2.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>I recommend buying cheaper used copies online (<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> $20)</strong>,
international is fine. There is a 3rd edition that is “updated”
and one that is not. I am using the “updated” edition. If you
buy the one that is not “updated,” your problem numbers will be
off.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a newer, 4th edition available. Do not purchase this!</p></li>
<li><p>We are <strong>not</strong> using any of the digital Pearson tools.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Stata</strong>: We will use Stata extensively in this course, including
outside of class. It is compatible with Windows/MacOS/Linux. You
should download a copy at <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/software/" class="uri">https://www.uvm.edu/software/</a>. Note that
there is a link to a pdf file that contains the licensing
information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MS Teams</strong> All class sessions will take place on Teams.</p></li>

<h1>Course components</h1>
<div id="video-lectures" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Video lectures</h2>
<p>I will post a series of videos each Friday night, with accompanying
slides. You can find all these on Blackboard. You should review these
and take a short quiz on Blackboard before coming to class on Monday.</p>
<p>After reviewing, you’ll take a <a href="/assignment#video-quizzes"><strong>video quiz</strong></a> on Blackboard. You need an 80% for credit, and you can make unlimited attempts. These must be completed before Monday class.</p>
</div>
<div id="class-meetings-m" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Class meetings (M)</h2>
<p>Live class meetings. I will review key concepts, we’ll work through some
problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="stata-labs-w" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Stata labs (W)</h2>
<p>Live class meetings. I will demonstrate some Stata techniques and you’ll
have time to practice. A final version of your <a href="/assignment#labs">lab</a> will be due before the next Monday class.</p>
</div>
<div id="qa-f" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Q&amp;A (F)</h2>
<p>Live class time (optional) to review lab questions, homework questions,
any questions!</p>

<div id="deadlines-and-extensions" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>Deadlines and extensions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>All deadlines are at 2:20pm.</p></li>
<li><p>As a general rule, problem sets are due on Fridays at 2:20pm. Video
quizzes and final labs are due on Mondays at 2:20pm.</p></li>
<li><p>Please submit all assignments through Blackboard. If you encounter
technical issues, e-mail is a fine last resort.</p></li>
<li><p>I have an “<strong>extensions for all</strong>” policy for all assignments. If
you need an extension, you should request it by e-mail <strong>before</strong>
the deadline. Provide (a) your work so far (if applicable)
and (b) a proposed new deadline. Some assignments build on previous
ones, so be careful when requesting that you don’t put yourself in a
tricky position. I don’t need to know why you need the extension.</p></li>
</ul>
<!---# Class Engagement and Attendance {#class-engagement-and-attendance .unnumbered}

This is a challenging course, and you'll get the most out of it if you
engage with the material both during and outside of class. I don't take attendance You are
responsible for finding a classmate or checking Blackboard for any
content you may miss during class. 

I don't take attendance explicitly,
but note that lab grades can only be submitted if you attend class.

<ul>
<li><p>I determine grades by a threshold - 93.01 is an A, and 92.97 is an
A-. In cases of very near misses of higher grades, however, I will
take into account class participation/attendance.</p></li>
<li><p>I will never curve quizzes down, but I may curve them up if the
median grade is less than a B-.</p></li>

<div id="quizzes" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>Quizzes</h1>
<p>There are two unit quizzes (15% each) and one stats quiz (5%). All
quizzes are open book. You should not collaborate.
The unit quizzes will have a Stata component and a written component. Quizzes are not
explicitly cumulative, but you’ll need to master skills from earlier
chapters to tackle the newer material.</p>
</div>
<div id="frequently-asked-questions" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>I don’t remember ANYTHING from statistics. Will I be able to pass
this class?</em> The stronger your stats background, the more useful
you’ll find this class. Whether or not you can recall the formula
for a one-sample hypothesis test should have no bearing on your
ability to succeed (you can always look it up!) But to have a sense
of what big concepts mean will be very important. We’ll
review together at the beginning of the term.</p></li>
<li><p><em>I am sick and need to miss class. Will I lose points? Do I need to
tell you?</em> You don’t need to let me know if you will be missing
class. If you need an extension,though, I will need to know that in
advance of the deadline.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Do I really need to buy a textbook?</em> Yes. 3rd (updated edition),
used.</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need a computer for this class? You will need a computer for any work with Stata. I <em>think</em> there is a way to get Stata to run on a Chromebook, but I can provide you with roughly zero technical support for setting that up!</p></li>
<li><p><em>My computer is broken/missing/on fire and I cannot submit my
assignment on time!</em> Give me a heads up prior to the deadline, and
we can work out an extension.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Can I use another software program (i.e. Excel, SPSS, EViews, R,
Gretl, etc.)?</em> In special cases, maybe. Talk to me first if you have
a compelling reason why you would like to use another program. It needs to be something with replicable code (ie R, not Excel). I
won’t be able to provide assistance with problem sets or your
project if you decide not to use Stata, and you will still be
responsible for any Stata-related questions that come up on quizzes.</p></li>
