<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to Problem Set 1! There are two “problem” exercises and one extended Stata exercise. You’ll need to submit three things on Blackboard: a problem set, log file, <em>and</em> a do-file.</p>
<p>Note that there are superscripted numbers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> throughout the page that provide additional information/suggestions to help you out.</p>

4. In any year, the weather can inflict storm damage to a home. From year to year, the damage is random. Let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> denote the dollar value of damange in any given year. Suppose that in 95% of the years, there is no damage (<span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span>), but in 5% of the years, <span class="math inline">\(Y = 20000\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>a. What are the mean and standard deviation of the damage in any year? 

b. Consider an &quot;insurance pool&quot; of 100 people whose homes are sufficiently dispersed so that, in any year, the damange to different homes can be viewed as inddependently distributed random variables. Let $\bar{Y}$ denote the average damage to these 100 homes in a year (i) What is $E[\bar{Y}]$? (i) What is the probability that $\bar{Y}$ exceeds $2000? </code></pre>

5. Grades on a standardized test are known to have a mean of 1000 for students in the United States. The test is administered to 453 randomly selected students in Florida; in this sample, the mean is 1013 and the standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) is 108.</p>
<pre><code>a. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average test score for Florida students 

b. Is there statistically significant evidence that Florida students perform differently than other students in the United States? How do you know? 

c. Another 503 students are selected at random from Florida. They are given a 3-hour preparation course before the test is administered Their average test scores is 1019 with a standard deviation of 95. 

(i) First, construct a 95% confidence interval for the **change** in the average test score associated with the prep course.  

(ii) Is there statistically significant evidence that the prep course helped?

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download <a href="../countymurders.dta"><code>countymurders.dta</code></a> to answer this question. The variable
<span class="math inline">\(murders\)</span> is the number of murders reported in the county. The
variable <span class="math inline">\(execs\)</span> is the number of executions that took place of
people sentenced to death in the given country. Most states in the
United States have the death penalty, but several do not.</p>

If you want to refer to a lot of variables, an asterisk (*) can act as a “wild.” So if you use <code>correlate var*</code>, it you’ll receive a correlation matrix of every variable with a name that starts with “var.” If you use <code>correlate *var*</code>, it will give you a correlation matrix of every variable with the letters “var” somewhere in the name.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
