<div id="objective" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of this submission is for you to translate your research idea
and data set into the outline of a workable paper. You can think of your
research proposal as summary of what your question is, why it matters,
and how you intend to solve it.</p>
<p>For this assignment, no <em>actual</em> analysis or datawork is necessary. However, you may find it helpful to work with your dataset to get a better sense of what empirical specifications are feasible.</p>
</div>
<div id="components" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Your proposal should be <u>four- to six-pages long</u> (double spaced,
excluding tables) and include the following components.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearly stated research question. What hypotheses are you testing?</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation - why is this important/interesting?</p></li>
<li><p>Link to related literature - what do we already know?</p></li>
<li><p>Data set - description of data set - make sure you include the
sources!</p></li>
<li><p>Empirical specification: You <strong>must</strong> include the empirical
specification of the regression(s) you are estimating, along with a
clear description of what each variable is.</p></li>
<li><p>Planned analysis: How will your results answer your research
question? What challenges/limitations will you face? This is a good
place to discuss any omitted variable bias, other possible
violations of our assumptions</p></li>
<li><p>Bibliography - for any references cited in your proposal plus any
data sources</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Outline of tables (not in page limit): In as much detail
as possible, outline the tables you plan to include (no numbers
necessary)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that the more detail you include, the better the feedback
youâ€™ll receive! A classmate will provide a peer review of your proposal,
providing feedback to help you turn your proposal into a final paper</p>
<p><strong>Consult the <a href="../materials/Proposal_Rubric.pdf">grading rubric</a> for additional guidance!</strong></p>
