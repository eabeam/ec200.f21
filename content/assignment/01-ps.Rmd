## Welcome

Welcome to Problem Set 1! There are two "problem" exercises and one extended Stata exercise. You'll need to submit three things on Blackboard: a problem set, log file, *and* a do-file. 

Note that there are superscripted numbers^[See?! Neat! :)  ] throughout the page that provide additional information/suggestions to help you out. 

## Exercises
    
   ||||||
| ----------: |  ----------: | ----------: | ----------: | ----------: |  
      |    X     |   -1   |  0   |   1    |  4|
|       $P(X=x)$ |  0.25  | 0.30 |  0.40  | 0.05|




1.  Consider the above random variable, $X$, with its associated
    probability distribution:

    a.  Draw the probability distribution function and the cumulative
        distribution function.

    b.  What is the expected value of X? That is, what is $E[X]$?

    c.  What is the variance of X?

2.  Stock and Watson 2.6, 2.10, (note that I originally assigned 2.18, 3.16, but the content is covered in Week 3 - you can submit these now _or_ with PS2) 

3.  For a randomly selected county in the United States, let $X$
    represent the proportion of adults over age 65 who are employed (the
    elderly employment rate). Then, $X$ is restricted to a value between
    zero and one. Suppose that the cumulative distribution function for
    $X$ is given by $F(x) = 3x^2 - 2x^3$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$.

    a.  What is the probability that the elderly employment rate is at
        least 0.5 (50%)?

    b.  What is the probability that the elderly employment rate is
        between 0.4 (40%) and 0.6 (60%)?

  <!-- 2.18 -->
4. In any year, the weather can inflict storm damage to a home. From year to year, the damage is random. Let $Y$ denote the dollar value of damange in any given year. Suppose that in 95% of the years, there is no damage ($Y=0$), but in 5% of the years, $Y = 20000$.

    a. What are the mean and standard deviation of the damage in any year? 
  
    b. Consider an "insurance pool" of 100 people whose homes are sufficiently dispersed so that, in any year, the damange to different homes can be viewed as inddependently distributed random variables. Let $\bar{Y}$ denote the average damage to these 100 homes in a year (i) What is $E[\bar{Y}]$? (i) What is the probability that $\bar{Y}$ exceeds $2000? 
  
  <!--3.16 -->
5. Grades on a standardized test are known to have a mean of 1000 for students in the United States. The test is administered to 453 randomly selected students in Florida; in this sample, the mean is 1013 and the standard deviation ($s$) is 108. 
    
    a. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average test score for Florida students 
    
    b. Is there statistically significant evidence that Florida students perform differently than other students in the United States? How do you know? 
    
    c. Another 503 students are selected at random from Florida. They are given a 3-hour preparation course before the test is administered Their average test scores is 1019 with a standard deviation of 95. 
    
    (i) First, construct a 95% confidence interval for the **change** in the average test score associated with the prep course.  
    
    (ii) Is there statistically significant evidence that the prep course helped? 
      

**For the following question, make sure you submit your do-file and log-file alongside your answers!**

3.  Download [`countymurders.dta`](../countymurders.dta) to answer this question. The variable
    $murders$ is the number of murders reported in the county. The
    variable $execs$ is the number of executions that took place of
    people sentenced to death in the given country. Most states in the
    United States have the death penalty, but several do not.

    1.  Keep only data from the year 1996. How many counties are
        there in the data set? Of these, how many have zero murders.
        What percentage of countries have zero executions?

    2.  What is the largest number of murders in a county? What is the
        largest number of executions in a county? 

    3.  Compute the correlation coefficient $r$ between `murders` and
        `execs` and describe what you find. ^[Remember, you can use `correlate var1 var2` to look at the correlation between two variables.] Estimate the correlation coefficient between `murdrate` and `execrate`.
        Why do the two coefficients differ so much?

    4.  What are two characteristics in the data that are highly
        correlated with county murder rates?^[If you want to look at the correlation between lots of variables, you can use `correlate var1 var2 ... var99`. If you want to refer to a lot of variables, an asterisk (*) can act as a "wild." So if you use `correlate var*`, it you'll receive a correlation matrix of every variable with a name that starts with "var." If you use `correlate *var*`, it will give you a correlation matrix of every variable with the letters "var" somewhere in the name.] What are their correlation
        coefficients?

    5.  What is median real per-capita income?^[`tabstat` is your friend!]

    6.  Generate a variable, `highinc` that is equal to 1 if a county
        has above-median real per capita income, and 0 otherwise. What
        is $E[rpcpersinc  | highinc =0]$? What is     $E[rpcpersinc | highinc =1]$?

    7.  Consider a two-sided hypothesis test of whether murder
        rates are different between counties with high (above median) vs
        low (below median) real per-capita personal income. Assume the
        two samples are independent, with equal variances. 
          a. First, write a null and alternative hypothesis 
          b. Use Stata to conduct the hypothesis test. What is the relevant t-statistic?^[The help file for `ttest` will be useful. Here we are conducting a two-sample t-test using groups. You will want to use the `highinc` variable you generated earlier.]
          c. Can you reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level?

    8.  Generate a variable, `perc1029`, that is equal to the share of
        the population between the ages of 10 and 29. What is the median
        share of the population by county that is ages **10-29**?

    9.  Generate a variable, `young`, that is equal to 1 if a county has
        an above-median share of the population that is age 10-29, and 0
        otherwise. What is $E[perc1029| young = 0]$? What is
        $E[perc1029| young =1]$?

    10. Consider a two-sided hypothesis test of whether murder rates are
        different between states with a high (above-median) share of the
        population ages **10-29** versus a low share. Assume the two
        samples are independent, with equal variances.
          a. First, write a null and alternative hypothesis 
          b. Use Stata to conduct the hypothesis test. What is the relevant t-statistic?
          c. Can you reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level?
