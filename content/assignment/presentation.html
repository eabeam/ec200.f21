<p><strong>Because timing is so tight, I’m no longer requiring you to view your classmate’s presentations - but I will circulate the links and encourage you to do so!</strong></p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You’ll prepare and deliver a 6-8 minute presentation of your paper, with accompanying slides. This will be one presentation per paper. If you are working with a partner, it should be one set of slides, with both members contributing.</p>
<p>Here is an example slide deck: <a href="../materials/example-f20.pptx">Example Presentation!</a></p>

<div id="guidelines-for-presentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Guidelines for presentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can record yourself giving your presentation in any way you see fit. The lowest-effort way to do this is to setting up a Microsoft Teams/Zoom meeting with yourself, share your screen, and recording that.</li>
<li>You can leave your camera off or on, whichever makes you more comfortable.</li>
<li>You should cover the main elements of your paper:</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Research questions</li>
<li>Background/motivation/related literature</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Empirical strategy</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Limitations/discussion</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>It doesn’t need to be scripted, but you should have practiced, such that your presentation flows smoothly.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to avoid reading directly off the slides.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be between 6 and 8 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>However you record it, you should upload it to a streaming site like <a href="https://streaming.uvm.edu/media/">UVM Streaming</a>, YouTube, or Microsoft Stream.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use the MS Teams approach, your recording will be automatically uploaded to Microsoft Stream. You may need to double check the settings to make sure I have permission to watch it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Blackboard:</strong> Submit a copy of your slides and a link to the video</p>
