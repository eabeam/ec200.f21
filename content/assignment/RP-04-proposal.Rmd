## Objective {#objective .unnumbered}


The goal of this submission is for you to translate your research idea
and data set into the outline of a workable paper. You can think of your
research proposal as summary of what your question is, why it matters,
and how you intend to solve it.

For this assignment, no *actual* analysis or datawork is necessary. However, you may find it helpful to work with your dataset to get a better sense of what empirical specifications are feasible.  

## Components {#components .unnumbered}


Your proposal should be [four- to six-pages long]{.ul} (double spaced,
excluding tables) and include the following components.

-   Clearly stated research question. What hypotheses are you testing?

-   Motivation - why is this important/interesting?

-   Link to related literature - what do we already know?

-   Data set - description of data set - make sure you include the
    sources!

-   Empirical specification: You **must** include the empirical
    specification of the regression(s) you are estimating, along with a
    clear description of what each variable is.

-   Planned analysis: How will your results answer your research
    question? What challenges/limitations will you face? This is a good
    place to discuss any omitted variable bias, other possible
    violations of our assumptions

-   Bibliography - for any references cited in your proposal plus any
    data sources

-   (Optional) Outline of tables (not in page limit): In as much detail
    as possible, outline the tables you plan to include (no numbers
    necessary)

Keep in mind that the more detail you include, the better the feedback
you'll receive! A classmate will provide a peer review of your proposal,
providing feedback to help you turn your proposal into a final paper

**Consult the [grading rubric](../materials/Proposal_Rubric.pdf) for additional guidance!**

## Submission requirements {#submission-requirements .unnumbered}

Your research proposal should be written in paragraph form (i.e.
complete sentences, not bullet points), copy-edited for
grammatical/spelling errors, and submitted as a word document.

## Examples {#examples .unnumbered}
See Teams for example proposals. These are not perfect, but they
are all of high quality.
