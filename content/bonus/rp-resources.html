<h3>Adapted from Wooldridge</h3>
<p>The following suggested topics are taken from Wooldridge. These can be
used as a starting point for your own idea generation. You can use these
questions as is, you can focus on a specific aspect of a question, or
you can add an additional subgroup or covariate to extend the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to access the referenced data sets, just let me know.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What factors might explain racial/ethnic and gender differences in
employment and wages? For example, Holzer (1991) reviewed the
evidence on the “spatial mismatch hypothesis” to explain differences
in employment rates between blacks and whites. Korenman and
Neumark (1992) examined the effects of childbearing on women’s
wages, while Hersch and Stratton (1997) looked at the effects of
household responsibilities on men’s and women’s wages. Push harder
than just identifying whether gender or racial/ethnic wage gaps
exist (they do!).</p></li>
<li><p>Do your own “audit” study to test for discrimination in hiring (by
race, gender, some other dimension). Have pairs of equally qualified
friends, say, one male and one female, apply for local job openings
in local bars or restaurants. You can provide them with phony
resumes that give each the same experience and background, where the
only difference is gender (or race, or something else). Then, track
who gets the interviews (and/or job offers). Neumark (1996)
described one such study conducted in Philadelphia. A variant would
be to test whether general physical attractiveness or a specific
characteristic, such as being obese or having visible tattoos or
body piercings, plays a role in hiring decisions. You would want to
use the same gender in the matched pairs, and it may not be easy to
get volunteers for such a study.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain monthly or quarterly data on teenage employment rates, the
minimum wage, and factors that affect teen employment to estimate
the effects of the minimum wage on teen employment. Solon (1985)
used quarterly U.S. data, while Castillo-Freeman and Freeman (1992)
used annual data on Puerto Rico. It might be informative to analyze
time series data on a low-wage state in the United States–where
changes in the minimum wage are likely to have the largest effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Do parental consent laws increase the teenage birthrate? You can use
state level data for this: either a time series for a given state
or, even better, a panel data set of states. Do the same laws reduce
abortion rates among teenager? The <em>Statistical Abstract of the
United States</em> contains all kinds of state-level data. Levine,
Trainor, and Zimmerman (1996) studied the effects of abortion
funding restrictions on similar outcomes. Other factors, such as
access to abortions, may affect teen birth an abortion rate.</p>
<p>There is also recent interest in the effects of “abstinence only”
sex education curricula. one can again use state-level panel data,
or maybe even panel data at the school district level, to determine
the effects of abstinence-only approaches to sex education on
various outcomes, including rates of sexually transmitted diseases
and teen birth rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Do change in traffic laws affect traffic fatalities? McCarthy (1994)
contains an analysis of monthly time series data for the state of
California. A set of dummy variables can be used to indicate the
months in which certain laws were in effect. The file TRAFFIC2
contains the data used by McCarthy. An alternative is to obtain a
panel data set on states in the United States, where you can exploit
variation in laws across states, as well as across time.
Freeman (2007) is a good example of a state-level analysis, using 25
years of data that straddle changes in various state drunk driving,
seat belt, and speed limit laws.</p></li>
<li><p>Use panel data to study the effects of various economic policies on
regional economic growth. Studying the effects of taxes and spending
is natural, but other policies may be of interest. For example,
Craig, Jackson, and Thomson (2007) study the effects of Small
Business Association Loan Guarantee programs on per capita income
growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Do differences in tax codes across states affect the amount of
foreign direct investment? Hines (1996) studied the effects of state
corporate taxes, along with the ability to apply foreign tax
credits, on investment from outside the United States</p></li>
