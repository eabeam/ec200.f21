<h2>What should I know?</h2>
<p>See the specific chapter guides from <a href="../04-content">Week 4</a>, <a href="../05-content">Week 5</a>, <a href="../06-content">Week 6</a>, and <a href="../07-content">Week 7</a>. You should understand all terms and definitions (be able to define and also apply them). You should also be comfortable interpreting regression output either written out in equation form or as Stata output. The level of PS2/PS3 problems is about right in terms of difficulty.</p>
<p>There will not be a Stata component to the exam.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-need-more-practice" class="section level2">
<h2>I need more practice!</h2>
<p>I recommend the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Odd-numbered problems from Stock and Watson - solutions are available <a href="../../bonus/general-resources">here</a></li>
<li><a href="#practice-exam">Practice exam</a></li>
<li><a href="#inclass-practice">In-class practice</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-structure-of-the-exam" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the structure of the exam?</h2>
<p>The exam will be a lot like a math exam - solving some problems and showing your work. I would expect about 3 multi-part questions. There may be some questions that involve definitions and/or true-false.</p>
<p>The exam is open book with a calculator allowed.</p>
<p>What is allowed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper notes</li>
<li>Textbook</li>
<li>Calculator (basic, scientific, graphing)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not allowed?</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Phone</del></li>
<li><del>Tablet</del></li>
<li><del>Laptop</del></li>

### In-class practice 

[Here are the problems](../practice/EC200-03-01practice.pdf) we covered in class.


And a video with solutions! I recommend working through the problems on your own **first**. 

`{{< youtube q_NbBSDWcpI >}}`{=html}

Or, download a [pdf of the solutions](../practice/EC200-03-01practice_solutions.pdf)



## Helpful materials {#helpful-materials}

Two things that may be useful to you: 

- [Standard Normal Distribution Table](../AppendixTable1_rev.pdf)

- [Formula chart](../Formula-sheet_f20.pdf): Is this all the knowledge you need to know? Of course not! But, this should cover most of the formulas you might need.
