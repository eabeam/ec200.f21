<div id="what-should-i-know" class="section level2">
<h2>What should I know?</h2>
<p>Make sure you are comfortable with the material chapter guides from <a href="../01-content">Week 2</a> and <a href="../02-content">Week 3</a>. What does comfortable mean? That you’re familiar with definitions and terminology, and that you can work through problems at the level of PS1 and PS2<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>There will not be a Stata component to the exam.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-need-more-practice" class="section level2">
<h2>I need more practice!</h2>
<p>I recommend the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Odd-numbered problems from Stock and Watson - solutions are available <a href="../../bonus/general-resources">here</a></li>
<li><a href="#practice-exam">Practice exam</a></li>
<li>[In-class practice (#inclass-practice)]</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-structure-of-the-exam" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the structure of the exam?</h2>
<p>The exam will “go live” during our scheduled class time at <strong>2:20pm on Monday, September 21</strong>. We will not meet :cry:. It will be “due” at <strong>3:20pm the same day.</strong> I’ve added an extra 10 minutes for scanning/deep breaths, but I didn’t add more to avoid conflicts with those who have class at 3:30pm.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a scheduling issue, please let me know ASAP.</strong></p>
<p>You will be asked to work through about 3-4 multi-part questions worth 30 points total. There are multiple versions of the exam.</p>
<div id="how-do-i-submit" class="section level3">
<h3>How do I submit?</h3>
<p>Work through on paper, then scan a copy and upload it onto Blackboard. Please use something like <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html">Adobe Scan</a> so that you can submit <strong>just one file in pdf form</strong>. In the past, I’ve found that uploading photos yields huge files that are difficult to grade.</p>
<div id="details" class="section level4">
<h4>Details:</h4>
<p>What should you make sure you include?</p>
<ul>
<li>Just one file per person</li>
<li>PDF version - review in advance to make sure the text is readable</li>
<li>Make sure your answers are numbered, but you don’t need to write out the questions</li>
<li>Please make sure pages are in order</li>
<li><strong>YOU MUST SHOW YOUR WORK</strong> for full credit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="in-class-practice" class="section level3">
<h3>In-class practice</h3>
<p><a href="../EC200-03-01practice.docx">Here are the problems</a> we covered/attempted to cover on Monday, September 14.</p>
<p>And a video with solutions! I recommend working through the problems on your own <strong>first</strong>.</p>
{{< youtube q_NbBSDWcpI >}}
<p>Or, download a <a href="../EC200-03-01practice_solutions.pdf">pdf of the solutions</a></p>
</div>
<div id="practice-exam-for-logisitics" class="section level3">
<h3>Practice exam! (For logisitics)</h3>
<p>Just to make sure we’re feeling good about logistics, I’ll post a “practice exam” on Blackboard that will go live at <strong>3:30pm on Friday, September 18</strong> (after our optional meet up) with one question. You can download it, work through the problem, scan it and upload your exam. It will be available until <strong>11:59 pm Sunday.</strong></p>
<p>I’ll review your submission and make sure there aren’t any problems with viewing your work.</p>
<p>Completion of the practice exam will be worth 2 points toward the exam (regardless of the accuracy of your answer).</p>
<!---
Following department policy, you will be required to use the Respondus lock-down browser with no back-tracking. 

I will ask you to 
## Responu--what? 

 all exams for the course require you to use the Respondus lock-down browser. This means you must use a Mac/PC for the exam, not a Chromebook or iPad. If this creates any problems for you, reach out to me and we can discuss options. 

From UVM: 
  > The LockDown Browser is like a normal browser, except that once you click “Begin” on your test, it prevents you from opening Word documents, instant messages, or email, and it blocks you from visiting other websites or accessing other parts of the course.
> 
> Important: You must download the browser from the URL below. Even if you have used the LockDown Browser at another school, it won’t work at UVM unless you use this version: [http://www.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=488814272](http://www.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=488814272).
>
> You only need to install it once for all tests in your UVM Bb courses.
> Note that you will need to use the LockDown Browser to see your grades and feedback, as well.

## Practice 

On Friday, I'll release an optional "practice" lock-down exam. It will have one practice questions, so we can all experience the glory of online testing. If you complete the pratice lock-down exam, you will earn 2 points toward the exam.
